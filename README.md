# Sketch Sublime Text Theme Template

Attempting to create a Sketch template to help with creating themes for Sublime Text.

This template will include all of the user interface elements that are available in Sublime Text. Or, at the very least, all that is needed visually to create a complete theme.

Each element is grouped and labelled to reflect it's Sublime Text Theme counterpart.

## Updates

1/21 - Work has begun on an actual theme based on the template. Plus I fixed the screenshot below. I stopped using Cloudapp and moved to [Dropshare](https://getdropsha.re/).

## Progress

![Screenshot of current progress](http://dch.link/Sublime-Text-Theme-Template/Sublime-Text-Theme-Template.png)

Almost every element is now included in the template. Those that aren't are likely to make more sense to simply update in your actual theme file.

## Icons

The template utilizes Google's Material Design icons and those contributed to [Material Design Icons](http://materialdesignicons.com) which is generously maintained by Austin Andrews ([@templarian](https://twitter.com/templarian)). 

Several of the icons have been created by yours truly. They will soon also be available at [Material Design Icons](http://materialdesignicons.com).

File format icons will be added soon.

## Font

This template utilizes the San Francisco font created by Apple. It's freely available at [Apple's Developer Fonts](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/) page.

## Feedback

I welcome any feedback or issues you may have. Please let me know by creating an issue here.

## Roadmap

- Convert as many elements as possible to symbols for easier updates.
- Create or utilize open source file icons
- Create boilerplate theme.
- Document theme creation process.
- Create Website.
