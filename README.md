# Sketch Sublime Text Theme Template

Attempting to create a Sketch template to help with creating themes for Sublime Text.

This template will include all of the user interface elements that are available in Sublime Text. Or, at the very least, all that is needed to create a complete theme.

Each element is grouped and labelled to reflect it's Sublime Text Theme counterpart.

## Progress

Almost every element is now included in the template. Those that aren't are likely to make more sense to simply update in your actual theme file.

## Roadmap

- Convert as many elements as possible to symbols for easier updates.
- Create boilerplate theme.
- Document theme creation process.
- Create Website.
